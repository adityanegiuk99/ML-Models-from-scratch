# ML-Models-from-Scratch

---

## üìñ Description

This repository contains various machine learning models implemented from scratch using Python. The primary goal is to gain a deep, fundamental understanding of how each algorithm works by building it from the ground up, relying only on libraries like NumPy for numerical computations.

This project is for educational purposes and is a great resource for anyone looking to look "under the hood" of common machine learning algorithms.

## ü§ñ Models Implemented

The repository is organized by model, with each folder containing a notebook or script for that specific algorithm:

* **[Linear Regression](https://github.com/adityanegiuk99/ML-Models-from-scratch/tree/main/Linear%20Regression)**
    * Implements simple linear regression and gradient descent to find the optimal line of best fit.

* **[Lasso Regression](https://github.com/adityanegiuk99/ML-Models-from-scratch/tree/main/Lasso%20Regression)**
    * An implementation of Linear Regression that includes L1 regularization (Lasso) to prevent overfitting and perform feature selection.

* **[Logistic Regression](https://github.com/adityanegiuk99/ML-Models-from-scratch/tree/main/Logistic%20Regression)**
    * A from-scratch implementation of the popular classification algorithm, using the sigmoid function and gradient descent to find the decision boundary.

* **[SVM Classifier](https://github.com/adityanegiuk99/ML-Models-from-scratch/tree/main/SVM%20Classifier)**
    * Implements the core concepts of a Support Vector Machine for binary classification.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need Python 3.x and the following libraries:
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook (for running the `.ipynb` files)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/adityanegiuk99/ML-Models-from-scratch.git](https://github.com/adityanegiuk99/ML-Models-from-scratch.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd ML-Models-from-scratch
    ```
3.  (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4.  Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
    ```

## Usage

Each folder contains a standalone implementation of a model. You can explore each one individually.

For example, to run the Linear Regression model:

1.  Navigate to the `Linear Regression` directory.
2.  Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  Open the `Linear Regression.ipynb` file from the Jupyter interface in your browser and run the cells.
