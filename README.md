ML-Models-from-Scratch
üìñ Description
This repository contains various machine learning models implemented from scratch using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal of this project is to provide a clear and concise implementation of popular ML algorithms, making them easier to understand for beginners.

ü§ñ Models Implemented
Currently, the following models are available in the repository:

Linear Regression: A simple yet powerful model for predicting a continuous-valued output.

Lasso Regression: A type of linear regression that uses L1 regularization to prevent overfitting.

Logistic Regression: A popular classification algorithm used to predict a binary outcome.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier: A powerful and versatile supervised machine learning algorithm for classification.

üöÄ Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
You will need to have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Installation
Clone the repo

Bash

git clone https://github.com/adityanegiuk99/ML-Models-from-scratch.git
Navigate to the project directory

Bash

cd ML-Models-from-scratch
Usage
Each model is implemented in its own Jupyter Notebook. To see the implementation of a specific model, navigate to the corresponding folder and open the .ipynb file.

For example, to view the Linear Regression model:

Go to the Linear Regression directory.

Open the Linear Regression.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
